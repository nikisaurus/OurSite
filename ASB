Quote: "I think what brings me to love ASB so much is the overall sense of worth and support I feel everyday from Ms. Dawson and the other officers.  I ran for the position mainly to become more involved, further myself in who I am, and to make an impact in the school community.  These all have occurred, but much more has too.  As ASB, we not only hold each other accountable and encourage growth in each others leadership qualities, but also have grown together as lifelong friends.  ASB has brought me to learn so much more of myself this year, and for that I am forever grateful. ASB is the best class ever known to women, and men too I guess :)." - Kelen Ahearn '15
