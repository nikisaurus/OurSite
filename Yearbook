Quote From Students: " “Yearbook staff is really cool because we are school leaders whether you think it of it that way or not. Even though we are not always seen, we are heard. I mean, the words in the yearbook are the ones students are going to remember when they’re eighty, and we are the ones who get to put them together. I think that’s so awesome.” – Riley Peterson ‘15 "
