Quote: "“This class centers around each person’s process of creating a theoretical business throughout the entire year. It broadened my knowledge of the business world, something I had previously known relatively little about. I learned how to create a business plan, write an effective resume, and how to speak persuasively ad confidently. The homework load is fairly light, and mainly consists of weekly readings and reflections.” – Julia Dolejsi ‘15"
