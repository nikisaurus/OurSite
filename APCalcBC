Quote From Students: " “The best preparation for college so far. It’s a very relaxing class, but the material is dense. You are responsible for getting your homework done, and making sure you understand the material. The class is very collaborative, and very inclusive. I’ve grown so much closer to my peers in this class, and I would highly recommend taking it. Plus, you eat doughnuts or other sweet treats on a regular basis!” – Summer Ott ‘15 "
