            <blockquote>Credits: <br>2 semesters, 1 credit per semester </blockquote>

            <p> Students will explore and develop personal moral concepts and precepts. The course fosters reflection on personal ethics so that students will implement these principles in their lives and service. The components of this course are:
Life in Jesus Christ: The purpose of this course is to help students understand that through Christ they can fully live out God’s plans for their lives. Students will learn the moral concepts and precepts that govern the lives of Christ’s disciples. This course will focus on the definition and formation of an informed conscience based on Catholic moral teaching and Sacred Scripture. Students will also prepare for, experience, and reflect upon a specific service commitment.
Sacraments as Privileged Encounters with Jesus Christ: Students will understand that they can encounter Christ today through the sacraments. Students will examine each of the sacraments in detail to learn how they may encounter Christ throughout their lives. The course will focus on the historical development of the sacraments, how they are celebrated today, and how they offer opportunities to reflect upon personal morality.
