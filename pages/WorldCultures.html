            <blockquote>Credits: <br>2 semesters, 1 credit per semester</blockquote>

            <p> Students will explore the foundations of Catholicism and the development of other religions. Students will have the opportunity to learn and practice skills used in social studies, such as note-taking, interpreting research, reading maps and graphs, and writing short essays. The components of this course are:
The Mission of Jesus Christ (The Paschal Mystery): This course introduces students of all backgrounds to Catholicism and the mission of Holy Names Academy. Students will learn about the redemptive mission of Jesus Christ and learn how discipleship challenges persons today. This theme emphasizes the concepts of an imperfect human condition (fall from grace) and the promise of salvation—ideas that are consistently present in all major world religions. It also emphasizes the concept of prayer and community service.
Ecumenical and Interreligious Issues: After learning about the Mission of Jesus, students learn about other faiths and how they strive to overcome the human condition through different forms of prayer and traditions. Learning about various religions in the 9th-grade year will establish a sense of community and understanding among students of various spiritual backgrounds. Students learn about the historical development of the Jewish faith; Christian diversity; and other religions, such as Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Eastern Traditions, through the eyes of the Church in the quest for religious truths and practice of morality.
