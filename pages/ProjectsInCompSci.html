</blockquote>
<p> 
This course will provide an opportunity for students who have completed the AP Computer Science course to expand their programming knowledge and work on significant projects of their choice. Lessons on software development processes, project design and management, and other topics will assist students in completing the project and advance their programming skills. Students taking this course will be expected to be self-directed and ambitious. Local computer scientists and programmers will mentor students to provide relevant examples of how programming is used in their field and industry. These projects will offer students the experience of creating relevant projects of their own design to demonstrate the value and power of computer science.
