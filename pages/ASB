        <div class="quote"> "I think what brings me to love ASB so much is the overall sense of worth and support I feel everyday from Ms. Dawson and the other officers.  I ran for the position mainly to become more involved, further myself in who I am, and to make an impact in the school community.  These all have occurred, but much more has too.  As ASB, we not only hold each other accountable and encourage growth in each others leadership qualities, but also have grown together as lifelong friends.  ASB has brought me to learn so much more of myself this year, and for that I am forever grateful. ASB is the best class ever known to women, and men too I guess :)." - Kelen Ahearn '15  </div>

            <p> Officers serve as four team members. The elected officers are responsible for many duties, including
leading ASB meetings, assisting co-class presidents with the planning of class meetings, planning and
publicizing school activities and dances, and representing the student body at required school functions.
ASB leaders are expected to be exemplary role models of respectful behavior and positive attitude.  (from the course catalog) </p>
