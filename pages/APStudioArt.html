            <p> AP Studio Art is designed for students interested in the serious pursuit of art. The curriculum does not culminate in a written exam; instead, students submit portfolios for evaluation by the College Board at approximately the same time as AP exams are given. The course offers three areas of focus: painting and drawing, two-dimensional design, and three-dimensional design. Students must select one of these categories in which to prepare a portfolio. Media included in each category are:
￼￼￼￼￼Drawing and Painting Two-Dimensional Design Three-Dimensional Design
Charcoal, pencil, watercolor, ink, and acrylic on canvas
Photography, painting, drawing, collage, and mixed media
Clay, paper sculpture, found-object sculpture, textiles, wire, and wood
Students begin the year developing the “breadth” section of their portfolio by participating in a number of activities that allow them to explore a variety of media. They are given the opportunity to design their own weekly project or participate in teacher-designed projects. After students have finished 13 works of art, they begin to develop their specific 12-piece “concentration” for their portfolios. (from the course catalog)
