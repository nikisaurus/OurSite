        <div class="quote"> “AP French is really fun because there aren’t set lesson plns so we spend a lot of days just discussing different things like freedom of speech or body image. It’s a great place to just talk and also work on your French. Also, we have French breakfast every Monday and they rock.” – Christine Schoeggl ‘15 </div>

            <p> The AP French Language course is an advanced course that reviews and refines grammar concepts that have been studied in the past. Emphasis is placed on the mastery of the French language and the deepening of students’ knowledge and understanding of the culture of Francophone countries. This course is conducted in French and all course materials are in French. It is important that students entering the course have a solid basic understanding of the French language, both written and spoken. French IV is a high-paced course and offers a quick review of many basic concepts and an in-depth study of grammatical details and exceptions. The focus of the course is students’ comprehension, self- expression, and cultural knowledge. (from the course catalog)
