            <p> The AP Spanish Language course is an advanced course that reviews and refines grammar concepts that have been studied in Spanish I, II, and III. Emphasis is placed on mastery of the Spanish language. Grammar and idiomatic expressions are covered in detail. It is essential that students entering the course have a basic understanding of the Spanish language, both written and spoken. This course is conducted entirely in Spanish. It is the expectation that students interact with their teacher and peers only in Spanish. Considerable accuracy in all four skills of language-learning is stressed, as well absolute accuracy in verb forms and other complex grammar points. Students must be willing to work diligently and make it a priority to maintain extra practice outside of the classroom, since this is a fast-paced course equivalent to a third-year college course. All materials, activities, and assessments have been chosen and designed to ensure advanced-level proficiency. All students who elect this course will be required to take the AP Spanish Language Exam. (from the course catalog)
