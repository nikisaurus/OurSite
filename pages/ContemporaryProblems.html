            <p> The course will examine current political, social, and global issues within the context of the social justice
teaching of the Church. Students will develop analysis and arguments through research of primary and
secondary sources. The components of this course are - Jesus Christ’s Mission Continues in the Church: Students will learn that the Church was founded by
Christ through the Apostles and is sustained by him through the Holy Spirit. The students will come to
know that the Church is the living Body of Christ today, which provides guidance for contemporary
problems. This Body has both divine and human elements. In this course, students will learn not so much
about events in the life of the Church but about the sacred nature of the Church. - Living as a Disciple of Jesus Christ in Society: Students will be introduced to the Church’s social
teaching. In this course, students will learn how Christ’s concern for others, especially the poor and
needy, is present today in the Church’s social teaching and mission. - (from the course catalog)  </p>
