Quote From Students: " Rock Band is the only class that you are encouraged to yell in. It is all creativity and self expression. Practices are lively and very fluid. Mr. Cudaback challenges you to establish what you think sounds the best and how to achieve it on your instrument. Also, you choose which practice times work for you and your band and scheduling is flexible. Not only do you learn from experience, but with the amazing opportunities to perform (ROCK SHOW!) you gain superb confidence in your performing skills. This is the best way to get your arts credit because it does not take up one of your 6 period day classes. It is an amazing way to meet and play other talented musicians. Rock Band is absolutely the most unique class offered at Holy Names." - Serafima Healy '17
