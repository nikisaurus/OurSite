Quote From Students: " “I love being a Spanish language assistant! Taking this class has been incredibly fun. I’ve been able to solidify my understanding of the language, and get to connect with my peers in a really unique way. It’s nice to have more leadership in the class, and be teaching and assisting your peers. I would highly recommend this class! Plus, you don’t have homework or final exams!” – Summer Ott ‘15 "
